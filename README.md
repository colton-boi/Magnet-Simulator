# Magnet Simulator
Magnet Simulator is a server on minehut.com (magnetsim.minehut.gg) made using [Skript 2.6.1](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases), [SkBee 1.15.0](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee/releases), [SkJade 1.4.0](https://github.com/Ankoki-Dev/SkJade/releases), [skript-reflect 2.2.3](https://github.com/TPGamesNL/skript-reflect/releases), and [Skript-Packet 2.0.1](https://github.com/Anarchick/skript-packet/releases)
We strive to be a unique server in the mess that Minehut has become, and we want our players to be able to easily make suggestions, help us code, and make fan games.

# What is Magnet Simulator
Magnet Simulator is based off of a [Roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/games/3486025575/Magnet-Simulator) that had thousands of players. You have a magnet and have to pick up coins, sell them, and upgrade your magnet range, backpack size, and buy pets!
